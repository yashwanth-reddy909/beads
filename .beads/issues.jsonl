Solution scales to arbitrary N\n2. Performance is acceptable with more clones\n3. Convergence time is bounded\n4. No edge cases in larger collision groups\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-0dcea000, bd-4d7fca8a to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:02:47.954306-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.182217-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T20:47:28.317007-07:00","source_repo":"."}

The actual problem was:\n\n**Import/Export hanging when daemon is running** due to SQLite lock contention:\n\n1. When daemon is connected, `PersistentPreRun` in main.go returns early without initializing the `store` variable\n2. Import/Export commands then tried to open the database directly with `sqlite.New(dbPath)` \n3. This blocked waiting for the database lock that the daemon already holds → **HANGS INDEFINITELY**\n\n## Solution Implemented\n\nModified both import.go and export.go to:\n1. Detect when `daemonClient` is connected\n2. Explicitly close the daemon connection before opening direct SQLite access\n3. Added debug logging to help diagnose similar issues\n\nThis ensures import/export commands always run in direct mode, avoiding lock contention.\n\n## File Path Handling\n\nThe file path confusion (issues.jsonl vs beads.jsonl) was a red herring. The code uses `filepath.Glob(\"*.jsonl\")` which correctly finds ANY `.jsonl` file in `.beads/` directory, so both filenames work.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-06T19:00:55.78797-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-06T19:07:15.077983-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-06T19:07:15.077983-08:00","source_repo":"."}

Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-cbed9619.3, bd-cbed9619.2 to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.974702-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:00:43.197709-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:00:43.197709-07:00","source_repo":"."}

Can we add a label/prefix to distinguish test issues from real issues?\n\nThese test issues have characteristics:\n- Empty descriptions\n- Generic titles like \"Test issue 0\", \"Bug P0\", \"Issue to reopen with reason\"\n- Created around 2025-11-07 19:00-19:07\n- Some assigned to test users like \"alice\", \"bob\", \"testuser\"","notes":"## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Problem**: Python MCP integration tests created test issues in production `.beads/beads.db` instead of isolated test databases.\n\n**Evidence**:\n- 29 test issues created on Nov 7, 2025 at 19:00-19:07\n- Patterns: \"Bug P0\", \"Test issue X\", assignees \"alice\"/\"bob\"/\"testuser\"\n- Git commit 0e8936b shows test issues committed to .beads/beads.jsonl\n- Tests were being fixed for workspace isolation around the same time\n\n**Why It Happened**:\n1. Before commit 0e8936b, `test_client_lazy_initialization()` didn't set `BEADS_WORKING_DIR`\n2. Tests fell back to discovering `.beads/` in the project root directory\n3. Auto-sync committed test issues to production database\n\n**Resolution**:\n1. ✅ Closed 29 test pollution issues (bd-0do3, bd-cjxp, etc.)\n2. ✅ Added `failIfProductionDatabase()` guard in Go test helpers\n3. ✅ Added production pollution checks in RPC test setup\n4. ✅ Created `conftest.py` with pytest safety checks for Python tests\n5. ✅ Added `BEADS_TEST_MODE` env var to mark test execution\n6. ✅ Tests now fail fast if they detect production database usage\n\n**Prevention**:\n- All test helper functions now verify database paths are in temp directories\n- Python tests fail immediately if BEADS_DB points to production\n- BEADS_TEST_MODE flag helps identify test vs production execution\n- Clear error messages guide developers to use proper test isolation\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- cmd/bd/test_helpers_test.go - Added failIfProductionDatabase()\n- internal/rpc/rpc_test.go - Added temp directory verification\n- integrations/beads-mcp/tests/conftest.py - New file with pytest safeguards","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-07T21:31:34.845887-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-07T21:57:30.892086-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-07T21:57:30.892086-08:00","source_repo":"."}

Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-cbed9619.3, bd-dcd6f14b to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T19:52:05.462747-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:00:43.198413-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:00:43.198413-07:00","source_repo":"."}

If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","notes":"## Recovery Session (2025-10-29 21:30)\n\n### What Happened\n- Created 14 new hash ID issues (bd-f8b764c9 through bd-f8b764c9.1) \n- bd sync appeared to succeed\n- Canonical repo (~/src/beads): 162 issues in DB + JSONL ✓\n- Secondary repo (fred/beads): Only 145 issues vs 162 in canonical ✗\n- Both repos on same git commit but different issue counts!\n\n### Bug Manifestation During Recovery\n\n1. **Initial state**: fred/beads had 145 issues, 145 lines in JSONL, 145 export_hashes entries\n\n2. **After git reset --hard origin/main**: \n   - JSONL: 162 lines (from git)\n   - DB: 150 issues (auto-import partially worked)\n   - Auto-import failed with UNIQUE constraint error\n\n3. **After manual import --resolve-collisions**:\n   - DB: 160 issues\n   - JSONL: Still 162 lines\n   - export_hashes: 159 entries\n\n4. **After bd export**: \n   - **JSONL reduced to 17 lines!** ← The bug in action\n   - export_hashes: 159 entries (skipped exporting 142 issues)\n   - Silent data loss - no error message\n\n5. **After clearing export_hashes and re-export**:\n   - JSONL: 159 lines (missing 3 issues still)\n   - DB: 159 issues\n   - Still diverged from canonical\n\n### The Bug Loop\nOnce export_hashes and JSONL diverge:\n- Export skips issues already in export_hashes\n- But those issues aren't actually in JSONL\n- This creates corrupt JSONL with missing issues\n- Auto-import can't detect the problem (file hash matches what was exported)\n- Data is lost with no error messages\n\n### Recovery Solution\nCouldn't break the loop with export alone. Had to:\n1. Copy .beads/beads.db from canonical repo\n2. Clear export_hashes\n3. Full re-export\n4. Finally converged to 162 issues\n\n### Key Learnings\n\n1. **The bug is worse than we thought**: It can create corrupt exports (17 lines instead of 162!)\n\n2. **Auto-import can't save you**: Once export is corrupt, auto-import just imports the corrupt data\n\n3. **Silent failure**: No warnings, no errors, just missing issues\n\n4. **Git operations trigger it**: git reset, git pull, etc. change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n\n5. **Import operations populate export_hashes**: Even manual imports update export_hashes, setting up future export failures\n\n### Immediate Action Required\n\n**DISABLE EXPORT DEDUPLICATION NOW**\n\nThis feature is fundamentally broken and causes data loss. Should be disabled until properly fixed.\n\nQuick fix options:\n- Set environment variable to disable feature\n- Comment out shouldSkipExport check\n- Always clear export_hashes before export\n- Add validation that DB count == JSONL line count before allowing export\n\n### Long-term Fix\n\nNeed Option 2 + 4 from proposed solutions:\n1. Store JSONL file hash after every successful export\n2. Before export, verify JSONL hash matches expected\n3. If mismatch, log WARNING and clear export_hashes\n4. Clear export_hashes on every import operation\n5. Add git post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n6. Add `bd validate` command to detect divergence\n","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.959435-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.207148-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-29T21:57:03.06641-07:00","source_repo":"."}

Since beads is designed to be run by AI agents, we should leverage AI to make migrations safer.\n\n## Current State\n\nMigrations run blindly with:\n- No pre-flight validation\n- No data integrity verification\n- No rollback on failure\n- Limited post-migration testing\n\nRecent issues:\n- GH #201: Migration didn't set issue_prefix config, breaking commands\n- bd-d355a07d: False positive \"data loss\" warnings on collision resolution\n- Users reported migration data loss (fixed but broader problem remains)\n\n## Proposal: AI-Supervised Migration Framework\n\nUse AI to supervise migrations through structured verification:\n\n### 1. Pre-Migration Analysis\n- AI reads migration code and current schema\n- Identifies potential data loss scenarios\n- Generates validation queries to verify assumptions\n- Creates snapshot queries for before/after comparison\n\n### 2. Migration Execution\n- Take database backup/snapshot\n- Run validation queries (pre-state)\n- Execute migration in transaction\n- Run validation queries (post-state)\n\n### 3. Post-Migration Verification\n- AI compares pre/post snapshots\n- Verifies data integrity invariants\n- Checks for unexpected data loss\n- Validates config completeness (like issue_prefix)\n\n### 4. Rollback on Anomalies\n- If AI detects data loss, rollback transaction\n- Present human-readable error report\n- Suggest fix before retrying\n\n## Example Flow\n\n```\n$ bd migrate\n\n→ Analyzing migration plan...\n→ AI identified 3 potential data loss scenarios\n→ Generating validation queries...\n→ Creating pre-migration snapshot...\n→ Running migration in transaction...\n→ Verifying post-migration state...\n✓ All 247 issues accounted for\n✓ Config table complete (issue_prefix: \"mcp\")\n✓ Dependencies intact (342 relationships verified)\n→ Migration successful!\n```\n\nIf something goes wrong:\n```\n$ bd migrate\n\n→ Analyzing migration plan...\n→ AI identified issue: Missing issue_prefix config after migration\n→ Recommendation: Add prefix detection step\n→ Aborting migration - database unchanged\n```\n\n## Implementation Ideas\n\n### A. Migration Validator Tool\nCreate `bd migrate --validate` that:\n- Simulates migration on copy of database\n- Uses AI to verify data integrity\n- Reports potential issues before real migration\n\n### B. Migration Test Generator\nAI generates test cases for migrations:\n- Edge cases (empty DB, large DB, missing config)\n- Data integrity checks\n- Regression tests\n\n### C. Migration Invariants\nDefine invariants that AI checks:\n- Issue count should not decrease (unless collision resolution)\n- All required config keys present\n- Foreign key relationships intact\n- No orphaned dependencies\n\n### D. Self-Healing Migrations\nAI detects incomplete migrations and suggests fixes:\n- Missing config values (like GH #201)\n- Orphaned data\n- Index inconsistencies\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Catch edge cases**: AI explores scenarios humans miss\n2. **Self-documenting**: AI explains what migration does\n3. **Agent-friendly**: Agents can run migrations confidently\n4. **Fewer rollbacks**: Detect issues before committing\n5. **Better testing**: AI generates comprehensive test suites\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Which AI model? (Fast: Haiku, Thorough: Sonnet/GPT-4)\n2. How to balance safety vs migration speed?\n3. Should AI validation be required or optional?\n4. How to handle offline scenarios (no API access)?\n5. What invariants should always be checked?\n\n## Related Work\n\n- bd-b245: Migration registry (makes migrations introspectable)\n- GH #201: issue_prefix migration bug (motivating example)\n- bd-d355a07d: False positive data loss warnings","design":"## Architecture: Agent-Supervised Migrations (Inversion of Control)\n\n**Key principle:** Beads provides observability and validation primitives.

UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda, bd-4d80b7b1\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration \u0026 Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-e6d71828, bd-7a2b58fc, bd-81abb639","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:48:00.267237-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T20:06:44.604643-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T20:06:44.604643-07:00","source_repo":"."}

Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.960352-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.19679-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-29T22:22:20.406934-07:00","source_repo":"."}

UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda, bd-4d80b7b1\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration \u0026 Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-e6d71828, bd-7a2b58fc,-1","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:23:57.978339-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-08T01:58:15.280264-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-08T00:54:51.171319-08:00","source_repo":"."}

In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update ID parsing logic\nAll places that parse IDs (utils.ExtractIssueNumber, etc.) need to handle new format.\n\n### 4.

When 5+ clones create issues with same ID, Git merge conflicts require manual resolution, and our collision resolver can fail during convergence rounds.\n\n## Research Question\nCould jujutsu (jj) provide better conflict handling for JSONL files?\n\n## Jujutsu Overview\n- Next-gen VCS built on libgit2\n- Designed to handle conflicts as first-class citizens\n- Supports conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) in some scenarios\n- Better handling of concurrent edits\n- Can work with Git repos (compatible with existing infrastructure)\n\n## Investigation Tasks\n1. JSONL Merge Behavior - How does jj handle line-by-line JSONL conflicts?\n2. Integration Feasibility - Can beads use jj as backend while maintaining Git compatibility?\n3. Conflict Resolution Model - Does jj conflict model map to our collision resolution?\n4. Operational Transform Support - Does jj implement operational transforms?\n\n## Deliverables\n1. Technical report on jj merge algorithm for JSONL\n2. Proof-of-concept: 5-clone collision test using jj instead of Git\n3. Performance comparison: Git vs jj for beads workload\n4.

The daemon silently fails for certain commands while appearing healthy.\n\nReproduction:\n1. Make local changes to issues (creates uncommitted .beads/beads.jsonl)\n2. Remote has updates (JSONL newer, triggers auto-import)\n3. Daemon tries to pull but fails: 'cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes'\n4. Daemon enters bad state - 'bd show' and other commands return EOF\n5. 'bd list' still works, daemon process is running, no errors logged\n\nTechnical details:\n- Auto-import check runs in handleRequest() before processing RPC commands\n- When import is blocked, it appears to corrupt daemon state\n- Likely: deadlock, unclosed transaction, or storage handle corruption\n- Panic recovery (server_lifecycle_conn.go:183) didn't catch anything - not a panic\n\nRequired fix:\n- Auto-import must not block RPC command execution\n- Handle git pull failures gracefully without corrupting state\n- Consider: skip auto-import if git is dirty, queue import for later, or use separate goroutine\n- Add timeout/circuit breaker for import operations\n- Log clear warnings when auto-import is skipped\n\nWithout this fix, users in collaborative environments will frequently encounter mysterious EOF errors that require daemon restarts.","design":"Options to fix:\n\n1. Skip auto-import when git is dirty (safest, simplest)\n   - Check git status before pull\n   - Log warning and continue without import\n   - User must manually import after cleaning git state\n\n2. Async import with timeout (better UX)\n   - Run auto-import in background goroutine\n   - Don't block RPC command execution\n   - Timeout after 5s, log error if stuck\n   - Use sync.Once or similar to prevent concurrent imports\n\n3. Transactional import with rollback\n   - Wrap import in database transaction\n   - Rollback if git operations fail\n   - Ensure storage is never left in bad state\n\nRecommended: Combine #1 and #2\n- Check git status first, skip if dirty\n- If clean, do async import with timeout\n- Add metrics to track import success/failure rates","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-02T17:15:25.181425-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-03T12:08:12.949061-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-03T12:08:12.949064-08:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-8931","depends_on_id":"bd-1048","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-02T17:15:25.181857-08:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}

Start Amp with beads MCP server configured\n2. Call `mcp__beads__set_context(workspace_root=\"/path/to/project\")`\n3. Use MCP tools successfully (e.g., `mcp__beads__show`, `mcp__beads__list`)\n4. Restart Amp (new thread/session)\n5. Try to use MCP tools without calling `set_context` again\n6. **Result**: \"Not connected\" or \"No workspace set\" errors\n\n## Impact\n- Amp agents silently fail when trying to read/update beads issues\n- May attempt to create duplicate issues because they can't see existing ones\n- Potential for data corruption if operating on wrong database\n- Breaks multi-session workflows\n- Creates confusion: CLI works (`./bd`) but MCP tools don't\n\n## Current Workaround\nManually call `mcp__beads__set_context()` at start of every Amp session.\n\n## Root Cause\nMCP server is stateful and doesn't persist workspace context across restarts.\n\n## Proposed Fix\n**Option 1 (Best)**: Auto-detect workspace from current working directory\n- Match behavior of CLI `./bd` commands\n- Check for `.beads/` directory in current dir or parents\n- No manual context setting needed\n\n**Option 2**: Persist context in MCP server state file\n- Save last workspace_root to `~/.config/beads/mcp_context.json`\n- Restore on server startup\n\n**Option 3**: Require explicit context in every MCP call\n- Add optional `workspace_root` parameter to all MCP tools\n- Fall back to saved context if not provided\n\nAcceptance:\n- MCP tools work across Amp restarts without manual set_context()\n- Auto-detection matches CLI behavior (walks up from CWD)\n- Clear error message when no workspace found\n- set_context() still works for explicit override\n- BEADS_WORKING_DIR env var support\n- Integration test validates restart behavior","design":"**Recommended Implementation: Option 1 (Auto-detect)**\n\n1. Workspace Discovery Algorithm (same as CLI):\n   - Start from CWD or provided directory\n   - Walk up directory tree looking for .beads/beads.db\n   - Cache result for performance\n\n2.

Repeat\n\n### Fix\nAdded `dbNeedsExport()` function in `integrity.go` that checks:\n- If JSONL exists\n- If DB modification time is newer than JSONL\n- If DB and JSONL issue counts match\n\nNow `bd sync` only re-exports if DB actually has changes that differ from JSONL.\n\n### Changes\n- Added `dbNeedsExport()` in `cmd/bd/integrity.go` (lines 228-271)\n- Updated `sync.go` lines 217-251 to check before re-exporting\n- Added comprehensive tests in `cmd/bd/sync_merge_test.go`\n\n### Testing\nAll tests pass including 4 new tests:\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_InSync` - Verifies no export when synced\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_DBNewer` - Detects DB modifications\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_CountMismatch` - Catches divergence\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_NoJSONL` - Handles missing JSONL\n\nThis prevents the weeks-long frustration of merge conflicts causing infinite dirty loops.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-05T17:52:14.776063-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-05T17:58:35.611942-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-05T17:58:35.611942-08:00","source_repo":"."}

Now it uses content-hash comparison (introduced in commit 2e87329), which produces different but deterministic results.\n\n## Example\nOld behavior: Issue with more references would be kept\nNew behavior: Issue with lexicographically lower content hash is kept\n\n## Solution\nUpdate each test to:\n1. Verify the new content-hash based behavior is correct\n2. Check that the remapped issue (not necessarily local/remote) has the expected content\n3. Ensure dependencies are preserved on the correct remapped issue\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All three autoimport tests pass\n- Tests verify content-hash determinism (same collision always resolves the same way)\n- Tests check dependency preservation on remapped issues\n- Test documentation explains content-hash scoring expectations\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `cmd/bd/autoimport_collision_test.go`\n\n## Testing\nRun: `go test ./cmd/bd -run \"TestAutoImport.*Collision\" -v`","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T19:17:28.358028-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.179059-07:00","source_repo":"."}

Keep as separate tool (current state)\n\nNext: Wait for response before proceeding with integration.\n\nUPDATE 2025-11-06: @neongreen gave permission to vendor!

These new commits aren't propagated to other clones, so they remain incomplete.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n**Option 1: Multi-round final sync**\n- After final pull, do additional sync rounds until all clones converge\n- Check convergence by comparing issue counts or content hashes\n- Maximum N rounds for N clones\n\n**Option 2: Iterative pull-import-push**\n- Each clone: pull → import with --resolve-collisions → push\n- Repeat until no new changes\n- Guaranteed convergence but may create commit spam\n\n**Option 3: Fix auto-import to be truly idempotent**\n- Ensure importing same JSONL multiple times produces no new commits\n- May require smarter content-based deduplication\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes without t.Skip\n- All N clones have all N issues after convergence\n- Convergence happens in bounded rounds (≤ N)\n- No data loss or duplication\n- Works for arbitrary N (tested with 5, 10 clones)\n\n## Impact\n\nThis is the final blocker for bd-cbed9619 epic completion.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T21:22:21.486109-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.180996-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-29T11:02:40.756891-07:00","source_repo":"."}

Add idempotency tests\n\nTest cases:\n1. Import same JSONL twice → second import reports all Unchanged\n2. Import, modify DB, import again → reports Updated\n3. Import with rename, import again → idempotent\n4. Import with collision resolution, import again → idempotent\n\n### 4. Update handleCollisions to use new flow\nCurrent handleCollisions in importer.go needs to be updated to:\n- Use content-first matching\n- Call new ResolveNWayCollisions\n- Apply results using ApplyCollisionResolution\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Import matches by content hash before checking IDs\n- Importing same JSONL multiple times is idempotent (reports Unchanged)\n- Rename detection works (same content, different ID)\n- ID conflicts resolved using global algorithm\n- Result.Unchanged correctly tracks idempotent imports\n- TestThreeCloneCollision passes\n- All existing import tests still pass\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- buildHashMap correctly indexes by content hash\n- buildIDMap correctly indexes by ID\n- handleRename deletes old, creates new, updates references\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Import same data twice → idempotent\n- Import renamed issue → handled correctly\n- Import with collision → resolved globally\n- Final pull after 3-way collision → all clones converge\n\n### Property Tests\n- Idempotency: Import(x); Import(x) ≡ Import(x)\n- Commutativity: Import(a); Import(b) ≡ Import(b); Import(a) (for non-colliding issues)\n- Convergence: After N rounds of sync, all clones identical\n\n## Files to Modify\n- internal/importer/importer.go (major refactor of ImportIssues)\n- internal/importer/importer_test.go (new tests)\n- cmd/bd/import_bug_test.go (update for new behavior)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5 (ContentHash field)\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.4 (read-only detection)\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.3 (global resolution)\n\n## Risk Mitigation\nMajor refactor of import logic.

Now it uses content-hash comparison (introduced in commit 2e87329), which produces different but deterministic results.\n\n## Example\nOld behavior: Issue with more references would be kept\nNew behavior: Issue with lexicographically lower content hash is kept\n\n## Solution\nUpdate each test to:\n1. Verify the new content-hash based behavior is correct\n2. Check that the remapped issue (not necessarily local/remote) has the expected content\n3. Ensure dependencies are preserved on the correct remapped issue\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All three autoimport tests pass\n- Tests verify content-hash determinism (same collision always resolves the same way)\n- Tests check dependency preservation on remapped issues\n- Test documentation explains content-hash scoring expectations\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `cmd/bd/autoimport_collision_test.go`\n\n## Testing\nRun: `go test ./cmd/bd -run \"TestAutoImport.*Collision\" -v`","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-08T03:09:48.253086-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-08T03:09:48.253086-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-08T02:28:35.317704-08:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-dd6f6d26","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.4","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-10-28T19:12:56.345276-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Added `ExecInTransaction` helper to SQLiteStorage for atomic database operations\n2. Added `IsUniqueConstraintError` function to detect UNIQUE constraint violations\n3. Wrapped `RemapCollisions` with retry logic (up to 3 attempts) with counter sync between retries\n4. Enhanced `handleRename` to detect and handle race conditions where target ID already exists\n5. Added defensive checks for when old ID has been deleted by another clone\n\n## Test Results\n\nThe changes improve N-way collision handling but don't fully solve the problem:\n- Original error: `UNIQUE constraint failed: issues.id` during first convergence round\n- With changes: Test proceeds further but encounters different collision scenarios\n- New error: `target ID already exists with different content` in later convergence rounds\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe issue is more complex than initially thought. In N-way scenarios:\n1. Clone A remaps bd-1c63eb84 → test-2 → test-4\n2. Clone B remaps bd-1c63eb84 → test-3 → test-4  \n3. Both try to create test-4, but with different intermediate states\n4. This creates legitimate content collisions that require additional resolution\n\n## Next Steps  \n\nThe full solution requires:\n1. Making remapping fully deterministic across clones (same input → same remapped ID)\n2. OR making `handleRename` more tolerant of mid-flight collisions\n3. OR implementing full transaction support for multi-step collision resolution -7c5915ae)\n\nThe retry logic added here provides a foundation but isn't sufficient for complex N-way scenarios.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:22:32.716678-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-02T16:46:45.864479-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-02T16:46:45.864479-08:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-e6d71828","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.1","type":"related","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:44:44.14653-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

README.md\nAdd section explaining hash IDs:\n```markdown\n## Issue IDs\n\nBeads uses **hash-based IDs** for collision-free distributed issue tracking:\n\n- **Hash ID**: `bd-af78e9a2` (8-char SHA256 prefix, immutable, globally unique)\n- **Alias**: `#42` (sequential number, mutable, human-friendly)\n\n### Using IDs\n```bash\nbd show bd-af78e9a2   # Use hash ID\nbd show #42           # Use alias\nbd show 42            # Use alias (shorthand)\n```\n\n### Why Hash IDs?\n- **Collision-free**: Work offline without ID conflicts\n- **Distributed**: No coordination needed between clones\n- **Git-friendly**: Different IDs = different JSONL lines, fewer merge conflicts\n\n### Aliases\nAliases are workspace-local shortcuts for hash IDs. They're:\n- Automatically assigned on issue creation\n- Reassigned deterministically on sync (if conflicts)\n- Can be manually controlled with `bd alias` commands\n```\n\n### 2. AGENTS.md\nUpdate agent workflow:\n```markdown\n## Hash-Based IDs (v2.0+)\n\nBeads v2.0 uses hash-based IDs to eliminate collision problems:\n\n**When creating issues**:\n```bash\nbd create \"Fix bug\" -p 1\n# → Creates bd-af78e9a2 with alias #1\n```\n\n**When referencing issues**:\n- In text: Use hash IDs (stable): \"See bd-af78e9a2 for details\"\n- In CLI: Use aliases (readable): `bd update #42 --status done`\n\n**After sync**:\n- Alias conflicts resolved automatically (content-hash ordering)\n- No ID collisions possible\n- No remapping needed\n\n**Migration from v1.x**:\n```bash\nbd migrate --hash-ids  # One-time migration\n```\n```\n\n### 3. QUICKSTART.md (if exists)\nShow alias usage in examples:\n```bash\n# Create issue (gets hash ID + alias)\nbd create \"Fix authentication bug\" -p 1\n# → Created bd-af78e9a2 (alias: #1)\n\n# Reference by alias\nbd show #1\nbd update #1 --status in_progress\nbd close #1 --reason \"Fixed\"\n```\n\n### 4. ADVANCED.md\nAdd section on hash ID internals:\n```markdown\n## Hash ID Generation\n\nHash IDs are generated deterministically:\n\n```go\nSHA256(title || description || timestamp || workspace_id)[:8]\n```\n\n**Collision probability**:\n- 8 hex chars = 2^32 space = ~4 billion IDs\n- Birthday paradox: 50% collision probability at ~65,000 issues\n- For typical projects (\u003c10,000 issues), collision risk is negligible\n\n**Collision detection**:\nIf a hash collision occurs (extremely rare), beads:\n1. Detects on insert (UNIQUE constraint)\n2. Appends random suffix: `bd-af78e9a2-a1b2`\n3. Retries insert\n\n## Alias Conflict Resolution\n\nWhen multiple clones assign same alias to different issues:\n\n**Strategy**: Content-hash ordering (deterministic)\n- Sort conflicting issue IDs lexicographically\n- Lowest hash ID keeps the alias\n- Others reassigned to next available aliases\n\n**Example**:\n```\nClone A: Assigns #42 to bd-a1b2c3d4\nClone B: Assigns #42 to bd-e5f6a7b8\nAfter sync: bd-a1b2c3d4 keeps #42 (lower hash)\n            bd-e5f6a7b8 gets #100 (next available)\n```\n```\n\n### 5. MIGRATION.md (new file)\n```markdown\n# Migrating to Hash-Based IDs (v2.0)\n\n## Overview\nBeads v2.0 introduces hash-based IDs to eliminate collision problems. This is a **breaking change** requiring migration.\n\n## Migration Steps\n\n### 1. Backup\n```bash\ncp -r .beads .beads.backup\ngit commit -am \"Pre-migration backup\"\n```\n\n### 2. Run Migration\n```bash\n# Dry run first\nbd migrate --hash-ids --dry-run\n\n# Apply migration\nbd migrate --hash-ids\n```\n\n### 3. Commit Changes\n```bash\ngit add .beads/issues.jsonl\ngit commit -m \"Migrate to hash-based IDs (v2.0)\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### 4. Coordinate with Collaborators\nAll clones must migrate before syncing:\n1. Notify team: \"Migrating to v2.0 on [date]\"\n2. All collaborators pull latest\n3. All run `bd migrate --hash-ids`\n4. All push changes\n5. Resume normal work\n\n## Rollback\n```bash\n# Restore backup\nmv .beads.backup .beads\nbd export  # Regenerate JSONL\ngit checkout .beads/issues.jsonl\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Can I mix v1.x and v2.0 clones?**\nA: No. All clones must be on same version.\n\n**Q: Will my old issue IDs work?**\nA: No, but aliases preserve the numbers: bd-1c63eb84 → #1\n\n**Q: What happens to links like \"see bd-cb64c226.3\"?**\nA: Migration updates all text references automatically.\n```\n\n### 6. CHANGELOG.md\n```markdown\n## v2.0.0 (YYYY-MM-DD)\n\n### Breaking Changes\n- **Hash-based IDs**: Issues now use collision-free hash IDs (bd-af78e9a2)\n  instead of sequential IDs (bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda)\n- **Aliasing system**: Human-friendly aliases (#42) for hash IDs\n- **Migration required**: Run `bd migrate --hash-ids` to convert v1.x databases\n\n### Added\n- `bd alias` command for manual alias control\n- `bd migrate --hash-ids` migration tool\n- Alias conflict resolution (deterministic, content-hash ordering)\n\n### Removed\n- ID collision detection and resolution (~2,100 LOC)\n- `bd import --resolve-collisions` flag (no longer needed)\n\n### Benefits\n- ✅ Zero ID collisions in distributed workflows\n- ✅ Simpler codebase (-1,350 net LOC)\n- ✅ Better git merge behavior\n- ✅ True offline-first operation\n```\n\n## Testing\n- Build docs locally (if using doc generator)\n- Check all links work\n- Verify examples are correct\n- Spellcheck\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- README.md (hash ID section)\n- AGENTS.md (workflow updates)\n- ADVANCED.md (internals)\n- MIGRATION.md (new)\n- CHANGELOG.md (v2.0 entry)\n- docs/ (any other docs)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.979971-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.611114-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.611114-07:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.981344-07:00","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.981767-07:00","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9.13","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.982167-07:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}

MCP Function Signatures (No Change)\nFunctions already use issue IDs as strings, so they work with hash IDs:\n\n```python\n# These already work!\nbeads_show(issue_id: str)           # Accepts bd-af78e9a2 or #42\nbeads_update(issue_id: str, ...)    # Accepts both formats\nbeads_close(issue_ids: List[str])   # Accepts both formats\n```\n\n### 2. Add Alias Resolution Helper\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/server.py\n\n```python\ndef resolve_issue_id(issue_id: str) -\u003e str:\n    \"\"\"Resolve alias to hash ID if needed.\"\"\"\n    # Hash ID: pass through\n    if issue_id.startswith('bd-') and len(issue_id) == 11:\n        return issue_id\n    \n    # Alias: #42 or 42\n    alias_str = issue_id.lstrip('#')\n    try:\n        alias = int(alias_str)\n        # Call bd to resolve\n        result = subprocess.run(\n            ['bd', 'alias', 'find', f'bd-{alias}'],\n            capture_output=True, text=True\n        )\n        if result.returncode == 0:\n            return result.stdout.strip()\n    except ValueError:\n        pass\n    \n    # Invalid format\n    raise ValueError(f\"Invalid issue ID: {issue_id}\")\n```\n\n### 3. Update Response Formatting\nShow aliases in responses:\n\n```python\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_show(issue_id: str) -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    resolved_id = resolve_issue_id(issue_id)\n    \n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'show', resolved_id], ...)\n    \n    # Parse response and add alias info\n    # Format: \"bd-af78e9a2 (alias: #42)\"\n    ...\n```\n\n### 4.

Agent A created 4 new issues and exported to issues.jsonl (commit 99a9d58)\n2. Agent A closed an issue and exported again (commit 58b4613) - JSONL now has 4 epics\n3.

Agent B's export **overwrote issues.jsonl**, removing the 4 epics created by Agent A\n6. Required manual recovery by re-exporting from Agent A's correct database\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n`bd export` should detect that the database is stale and either:\n- **Refuse to export** with error message explaining the issue\n- **Warn prominently** and require explicit --force flag to override\n- **Auto-import first** to sync database before exporting\n\n## How to Detect Staleness\n\nCompare modification times (similar to VC's ValidateDatabaseFreshness):\n1.

This gives false confidence that everything is synced with the source of truth.\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Start with database synced to working tree .beads/issues.jsonl (376 issues)\n2. Git HEAD has older version of .beads/issues.jsonl (354 issues)\n3. Run: bd import .beads/issues.jsonl\n4.

Detect uncommitted changes: git diff --quiet HEAD .beads/issues.jsonl\n2. Warn user: 'Warning: .beads/issues.jsonl has uncommitted changes (376 lines vs 354 in HEAD)'\n3. Clarify status: 'Import complete: 0 created, 0 updated (already synced with working tree)'\n4. Recommend: 'Run git diff .beads/issues.jsonl to review uncommitted work'\n\n## Impact\n\n- Users can't trust 'bd import' status messages\n- Silent data loss risk if user assumes synced and runs git checkout\n- Breaks mental model of 'JSONL in git = source of truth'\n- Critical for VC's landing-the-plane workflow","acceptance_criteria":"1. bd import detects when working tree differs from git HEAD\n2.
