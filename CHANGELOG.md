# Changelog

All notable changes to the beads project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.23.1] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed

- **#263: Database mtime not updated after import causing false `bd doctor` warnings**
  - When `bd sync --import-only` completed, SQLite WAL mode wouldn't update the main database file's mtime
  - This caused `bd doctor` to incorrectly warn "JSONL is newer than database" even when perfectly synced
  - Now updates database mtime after imports to prevent false warnings

- **#261: SQLite URI missing 'file:' prefix causing version detection failures**
  - Without 'file:' scheme, SQLite treated `?mode=ro` as part of filename instead of connection option
  - Created bogus files like `beads.db?mode=ro`
  - Caused `bd doctor` to incorrectly report "version pre-0.17.5 (very old)" on modern databases

- **bd-17d5: Conflict marker false positives on JSON-encoded content**
  - Issues containing JSON strings with `<<<<<<<` would trigger false conflict marker detection
  - Now checks raw bytes before JSON decoding to avoid false positives

- **bd-ckvw: Schema compatibility probe prevents silent migration failures**
  - Migrations could fail silently, causing cryptic "no such column" and UNIQUE constraint errors later
  - Now probes schema after migrations, retries once if incomplete, and fails fast with clear error
  - Daemon refuses RPC if client has newer minor version to prevent schema mismatches

- **#264/#262: Remove stale `--resolve-collisions` references**
  - Docs/error messages still referenced `--resolve-collisions` flag (removed in v0.20)
  - Fixed post-merge hook error messages and git-hooks README

### Changed

- **bd-auf1: Auto-cleanup snapshot files after successful merge**
  - `.beads/` no longer accumulates orphaned `.base`, `.ours`, `.theirs` snapshot files after merges

- **bd-ky74: Optimize CLI tests with in-process testing**
  - Converted exec.Command() tests to in-process rootCmd.Execute() calls
  - **Dramatically faster: 10+ minutes → just a few seconds**
  - Improved test coverage from 20.2% to 23.3%

- **bd-6uix: Message system improvements**
  - 30s HTTP timeout prevents hangs, full message reading, --importance validation, server-side filtering

- **Remove noisy version field from metadata.json**
  - Eliminated redundant version mismatch warnings on every bd upgrade
  - Daemon version checking via RPC is sufficient

### Fixed

- **Critical Double JSON Encoding Bug** (bd-1048, bd-4ec8): Fixed widespread bug in daemon RPC calls where `ResolveID` responses were incorrectly converted using `string(resp.Data)` instead of `json.Unmarshal`. This caused IDs to become double-quoted (`"\"bd-1048\""`) and database lookups to fail. Affected commands:

  - `bd dep add/remove/tree` - 5 instances
  - `bd label add/remove/list` - 3 instances

  - Migration inspection tools for AI agents (bd-627d)
  - Conflict marker detection in `bd import` and `bd validate`
  - Git hooks health check in `bd doctor`
  - External reference (`external_ref`) UNIQUE constraint and validation

### Changed
- Homebrew formula now auto-published in main repo via GoReleaser
- Deprecated separate homebrew-beads tap repository

## [0.21.1] - 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Version bump for consistency across CLI, MCP server, and plugin

## [0.20.1] - 2025-10-31

### Breaking Changes

- **Hash-Based IDs Now Default**: Sequential IDs (bd-1, bd-2) replaced with hash-based IDs (bd-a1b2, bd-f14c)
  - 4-character hashes for 0-500 issues
  - 5-character hashes for 500-1,500 issues  
  - 6-character hashes for 1,500-10,000 issues
  - Progressive length extension prevents collisions with birthday paradox math
  - **Migration required**: Run `bd migrate` to upgrade schema (removes `issue_counters` table)
  - Existing databases continue working - migration is opt-in
  - Dramatically reduces merge conflicts in multi-worker/multi-branch workflows
  - Eliminates ID collision issues when multiple agents create issues concurrently

### Removed

- **Sequential ID Generation**: Removed `SyncAllCounters()`, `AllocateNextID()`, and collision remapping logic (bd-c7af, bd-8e05, bd-4c74)
  - Hash IDs handle collisions by extending hash length, not remapping
  - `issue_counters` table removed from schema
  - `--resolve-collisions` flag removed from import (no longer needed)
  - 400+ lines of obsolete collision handling code removed

### Changed

- **Collision Handling**: Automatic hash extension on collision instead of ID remapping
  - Much simpler and more reliable than sequential remapping
  - No cross-branch coordination needed
  - Birthday paradox ensures extremely low collision rates

### Migration Notes

**For users upgrading from 0.20.0 or earlier:**

1. Run `bd migrate` to detect and upgrade old database schemas
2. Database continues to work without migration, but you'll see warnings
3. Hash IDs provide better multi-worker reliability at the cost of non-numeric IDs
4. Old sequential IDs like `bd-152` become hash IDs like `bd-f14c`

See README.md for hash ID format details and birthday paradox collision analysis.

git pull && go build -o bd ./cmd/bd
```

**Note**: The `bd compact` command requires an Anthropic API key in `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. All other features work without any additional setup.

### Upgrading to 0.9.2

No breaking changes. All changes are backward compatible:
- **--deps flag**: Optional new feature for `bd create`
- **external_ref**: Optional field, existing issues unaffected
- **Metadata table**: Auto-migrates on first use
- **Bug fixes**: All critical fixes are transparent to users

Simply pull the latest version and rebuild:
```bash
go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
# or
git pull && go build -o bd ./cmd/bd
```

### Upgrading to 0.9.1

No breaking changes. All changes are backward compatible:
- **Auto-migration**: The dirty_issues table is automatically added to existing databases
- **Auto-flush/import**: Enabled by default, improves workflow (can disable with flags if needed)
- **ID partitioning**: Optional feature, use `--id` flag only if needed for parallel workers

If you're upgrading from 0.9.0, simply pull the latest version. Your existing database will be automatically migrated on first use.

### Upgrading to 0.9.0

No breaking changes. The JSONL export format is backward compatible.

If you have issues in your database:
1. Run `bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl` to create the text file
2. Commit `.beads/issues.jsonl` to git
3. Add `.beads/*.db` to `.gitignore`

New collaborators can clone the repo and run:
```bash
bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl
```

The SQLite database will be automatically populated from the JSONL file.
