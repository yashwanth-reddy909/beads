# bd (beads) pre-commit hook
#
# This hook ensures that any pending bd issue changes are flushed to
# .beads/beads.jsonl before the commit is created, preventing the
# race condition where daemon auto-flush fires after the commit.
#
# Installation:
#   cp examples/git-hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
#   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
#
# Or use the install script:
#   examples/git-hooks/install.sh

# Check if bd is available
if ! command -v bd >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Warning: bd command not found, skipping pre-commit flush" >&2
    exit 0
fi

# Check if we're in a bd workspace
if [ ! -d .beads ]; then
    # Not a bd workspace, nothing to do
    exit 0
fi

# Flush pending changes to JSONL
# Use --flush-only to skip git operations (we're already in a git hook)
# Suppress output unless there's an error
if ! bd sync --flush-only >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Error: Failed to flush bd changes to JSONL" >&2
    echo "Run 'bd sync --flush-only' manually to diagnose" >&2
    exit 1
fi

# Stage both possible JSONL files (backward compatibility)
# git add is harmless if file doesn't exist
for f in .beads/beads.jsonl .beads/issues.jsonl; do
    [ -f "$f" ] && git add "$f" 2>/dev/null || true
done

exit 0
